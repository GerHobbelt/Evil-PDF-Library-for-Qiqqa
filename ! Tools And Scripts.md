# Tools & Scripts

The `.sh` bash shell scripts in this directory include scripts to assist in bulk-testing our own mupdf-based PDF processing tools (these are part of the Qiqqa toolkit).

The included `DirScanner.exe` is a Windows CLI binary (executable); source code is available [here](https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/tree/master/Technology%20Tests/NTFS%20Find%20hardlinks%20or%20regular%20files).
