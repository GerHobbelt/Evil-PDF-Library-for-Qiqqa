# Qiqqa Unit + Systeem Tests test data

A reduced set of PDFs (and other files) which are used in the Qiqqa Unit Tests and System Tests as 'source material' a.k.a. 'fixtures'.

The corresponding reference outputs (German: *SollWerte*) are kept in `../TestResults/`, which mirrors the *base* directory tree  (`../`) to ensure that every file and test has a systematically identifiable reference file to compare against.
