# Qiqqa Unit + Systeem Tests test data

The reference outputs (German: *SollWerte*) for the Unit and system tests as applied to `../TestData` and other directories in this corpus. The directory tree in here mirrors the *base* directory tree (`../`) to ensure that every file and test has a systematically identifiable reference file to compare against.
