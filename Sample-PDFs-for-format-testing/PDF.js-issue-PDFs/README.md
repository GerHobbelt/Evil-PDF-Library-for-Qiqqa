# PDF Test Files for Qiqqa R&D

The PDF file repository stored here is for testing various PDF reader libraries and other PDF tools, such as Qiqqa.

This particular collection has been gathered while researching viability of using [Mozilla PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/) as part of the migration/upgrade of Qiqqa -- see also the [\[Progress in Development - Considering the way forward - Essential yet hard(er) to port UI features\](https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/blob/master/docs-src/Progress%20in%20Development%20-%20Considering%20the%20way%20forward%20-%20Essential%20yet%20hard(er)%20to%20port%20UI%20features.md) and [\[Progress in Development :: Considering the way forward : Hashing and caching PDFs\]](https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source/blob/master/docs-src/Progress%20in%20Development%20-%20Considering%20the%20way%20forward%20-%20Qiqqa%20library%20storage%2C%20database%2C%20DropBox%20(and%20*frenemies*)%2C%20backups%20and%20backwards%20compatibility.md#hashing-and-caching-pdfs) essays in the [Qiqqa](https://github.com/jimmejardine/qiqqa-open-source) repo.

Most of these have been collected from the [PDF.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/) repo issue tracker, while others were obtained via articles *about* PDF.js. [\[Perez1]](https://www.pdftron.com/blog/pdf-js/guide-to-pdf-js-rendering/) [\[Perez2]](https://www.pdftron.com/blog/pdf-js/guide-to-evaluating-pdf-js/) [\[Perez3]](https://www.pdftron.com/blog/pdf-js/pdf-js-build-vs-buy/)

The files include PDFs with plenty trouble for any PDF renderer, so we'll feed them to all candidate PDF render libraries to see who will pass and who will fail...



## Security Considerations

Note that these PDFs have been grabbed off the Internet (and some of them have been subsequently altered to suit various tests) and some are highly suspect, including Embedded JavaScript.

Make sure to DISABLE JavaScript in your Acrobat Reader and other PDF readers/viewers!

**Cave canem.**
