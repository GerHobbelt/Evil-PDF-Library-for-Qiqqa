For working on the Qiqqa hash functions, I need a couple of PDFs which exhibit the b0rked Qiqqa hash, i.e. shortened SHA1.

These examples all hash to a Qiqqa Classic fingerprint that's 37 characters wide only (as the MSN (Most Significant Nibble) zeroes are dropped in the original fingerprint hash producing code).
