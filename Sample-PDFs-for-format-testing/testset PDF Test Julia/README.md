# PDFTest

We have been developing PDF Reader APIs in Julia ([PDFIO](https://github.com/sambitdash/PDFIO.jl)) for sometime now. As part of the project, 
We need to test the APIs with various test files. The PDF files used for testing may have
license restrictions that may not be compliant with *MIT License* that PDFIO APIs comply to. 
The PDF file repository developed here is merely for testing the PDFIO APIs. The following 
limitations apply to the usage of these PDF files.
